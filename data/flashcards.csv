What are the five founding payment brands of the PCI SSC?,"American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, Mastercard, and Visa Inc.",1,,PCI SSC Overview
What is the difference between a four-party and a three-party card payment model?,"In a four-party model (Visa, Mastercard), the issuer and acquirer are separate banks. In a three-party model (Amex, Discover), one entity acts as both issuer and acquirer.",1,,Payment Industry Overview
What is an issuer in the payment card ecosystem?,A financial institution (bank) that issues payment cards to cardholders on behalf of a card brand,1,,Payment Industry Overview
What is an acquirer in the payment card ecosystem?,"A financial institution (bank) that establishes relationships with merchants to process card payments, also called a merchant bank or acquiring bank",1,,Payment Industry Overview
What is the difference between a payment processor and a payment gateway?,"A payment processor routes and settles transactions between acquirers and issuers. A payment gateway is the technology that securely transmits transaction data from the merchant to the processor, often used in e-commerce.",1,,Payment Industry Overview
What does CHD stand for and what does it include?,"Cardholder Data. It includes the Primary Account Number (PAN), cardholder name, expiration date, and service code.",1,,PCI DSS v4.0.1 Req 3

What must entities do to manage TPSP compliance per PCI DSS?,"Maintain a list of all TPSPs, maintain a written agreement acknowledging the TPSP's responsibility for CHD security, ensure a process for engaging TPSPs includes due diligence, monitor TPSPs' PCI DSS compliance status at least annually, and maintain information about which PCI DSS requirements are managed by each TPSP versus the entity.",5,,PCI DSS v4.0.1 Req 12.8
What are future-dated requirements in PCI DSS v4.0.1?,"Requirements identified as best practices until March 31, 2025, after which they become mandatory. These were new requirements introduced in v4.0 that organizations were given extra time to implement. After the future date passes, they are assessed as full requirements.",5,,PCI DSS v4.0.1 Summary of Changes
What is tokenization?,"A process that replaces a PAN with a surrogate value (token) that has no exploitable value. The original PAN is stored securely in a token vault. Tokenization can reduce PCI DSS scope for systems that only store, process, or transmit tokens rather than actual PANs.",2,,PCI DSS v4.0.1 Tokenization Guidelines
What is point-to-point encryption (P2PE)?,"A PCI SSC-validated solution that encrypts cardholder data from the point of interaction (e.g., payment terminal) to the secure decryption environment. P2PE solutions can significantly reduce PCI DSS scope for merchants because encrypted data in transit through their environment is not accessible.",2,,PCI SSC P2PE Standard
